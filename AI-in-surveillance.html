            <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-6">The Rise of AI in Surveillance</h1>
            <p class="mb-6">1984, the novel by George Orwell, is widely regarded as a prophetic exploration of totalitarianism, particularly its use of technology for surveillance and control. In the world of 1984, telescreens monitor individuals' every move, capturing both visual and auditory data. The idea that people behave as though they are being watched, even if they aren’t, mirrors modern concerns about AI-enhanced surveillance tools. </p>
                
            <p class="mb-6">Fast fordward to today, and we can already see that AI-driven surveillance is rapidly transforming how governments and corporations monitor populations. While some argue that these advancements enhance security and efficiency, the growing reliance on AI in surveillance is a severe threat to privacy and individual freedoms.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Governmental Use of AI in Surveillance</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">Governments worldwide are increasingly deploying AI technologies for surveillance purposes. While these advancements promise improved operational efficiency and crime prevention, they also raise serious concerns about privacy and misuse of power. Emerging laws and regulations, such as the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/news/ai-act-enters-force-2024-08-01_en" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">European Union’s AI Act</a>, seek to create a balance between technological innovation and safeguarding individual rights. However, these frameworks remain a double-edged sword, as they can either mitigate or exacerbate the risks associated with AI-driven surveillance.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Colliers' Office Space Utilization Analysis</h3>
                    <p class="mb-6">In Melbourne, the commercial real estate firm Colliers implemented AI technology to track and analyze office movements of employees by assessing Wi-Fi usage. This technology helps determine if businesses can reduce their office space based on how employees use the office. The data collected is anonymous, focusing on team movements rather than individuals. This innovative use of AI aims to optimize office space, especially post-Covid, where fluctuating occupancy rates are common. <a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/real-estate/commercial/colliers-companies-are-using-ai-to-track-how-many-employees-are-showing-up-to-the-office-and-what-they-do-with-their-day/news-story/00901b2cfa64fc43b7acbac62d364b2a" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">Source</a>.</p>
                    
                            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">How is the Legal and Regulatory Landscape Responding?</h2>
                            <p class="mb-6">As AI becomes increasingly integrated into surveillance practices, governments and international bodies are developing legal frameworks to address the associated ethical and privacy concerns. Take for example the current approaches of the European Union and the United States.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">European Union's AI Act</h3>
                            <p class="mb-6">The <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/news/ai-act-enters-force-2024-08-01_en" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">European Union (EU) Artificial Intelligence Act</a> is a comprehensive regulatory framework that entered into force on August 1, 2024. This legislation aims to foster the development and uptake of safe and trustworthy AI systems across the EU, ensuring respect for fundamental rights and safety.</p>
                            <p class="mb-6">The AI Act categorizes AI systems based on their risk levels and imposes corresponding obligations:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                                <li><strong>Minimal Risk:</strong> AI systems such as spam filters and AI-enabled video games face no obligations under the AI Act, but companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of conduct.</li>
                                <br><li><strong>Specific Transparency Risk:</strong> Systems like chatbots must clearly inform users that they are interacting with a machine, while certain AI-generated content must be labeled as such.</li>
                                <br><li><strong>High Risk:</strong> AI systems such as AI-based medical software or AI systems used for recruitment must comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitigation systems, high-quality data sets, clear user information, and human oversight.</li>
                                <br><li><strong>Unacceptable Risk:</strong> AI systems that allow "social scoring" by governments or companies are considered a clear threat to people's fundamental rights and are therefore banned.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="mb-6">The AI Act also introduces limitations on real-time biometric surveillance by governments, permitting it only under specific circumstances such as a real and present or foreseeable threat of terrorist attack.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">United States' Approach to AI Governance</h3>
                            <p class="mb-6">In the United States, AI governance is evolving through a combination of executive actions, agency guidelines, and legislative proposals. On October 30, 2023, President Biden issued an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/?" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence</a>, outlining key principles and priorities for governing AI in the United States.</p>
                            <p class="mb-6">The policy emphasizes eight guiding principles and priorities:</p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                                <li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> AI systems must be safe, secure, and undergo robust evaluations before deployment.</li>
                                <br><li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> AI companies should provide transparency about how their models work. Standards for labeling AI-generated content will be established.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="mb-6">Additionally, various federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have issued guidelines and frameworks to promote ethical AI development and protect consumer rights. For instance, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">NIST's AI Risk Management Framework</a> provides voluntary guidance to help organizations manage risks associated with AI.</p>
                            
                            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
                            <p class="mb-6">The unchecked deployment of AI-powered tools like facial recognition, emotion detection, and predictive algorithms is eroding privacy at an unprecedented scale. Governments exploit these tools for mass monitoring, while corporations use them to track employees and consumers, often without meaningful consent or oversight.</p>
                            <p class="mb-6">Regulatory efforts, such as the European Union’s AI Act and the United States’ evolving frameworks, are a step in the right direction but remain insufficient in preventing misuse and protecting fundamental rights. At the end of the day, we must ask ourselves: how much of our privacy are we willing to trade for convenience and security?</p>
